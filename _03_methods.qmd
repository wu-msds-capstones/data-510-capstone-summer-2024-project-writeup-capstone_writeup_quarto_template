# Methods

Raw data
--Aggregate to county level to get a more localized look at what is going on
1.  Looked at linear correlations with pearson correlation and linear regression measuring r^2 and p-value for significance.
1a. Mann-Kendall Trend - to look for significance of trends in housing and income over our timespan
2.  Created Linear Model to look at the affects of inventory and housing units on median sales prices.  Tested all
assumptions of linear regression to ensure the model was accurate.
3.  Looked at pre-COVID and post-COVID


Feature Engineering
1.  Engineered several features:
- median monthly payment consisting of average mortgage rate, number of payments (30 years), 80% of the median sale price
- unaffordability index - ratio of median sale price and median income (used in at least one article found - look up reference)
