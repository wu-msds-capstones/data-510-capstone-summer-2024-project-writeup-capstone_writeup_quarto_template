# Methods

The inputs to housing affordability are complex and, often times, intertwined.

#### Project Data Ideation
The data used for this project, the methods for gathering and cleaning the data, and the storage mechanisms are detailed in the [Data](capstone.html#data) section below.
In this section, we wanted to speak to the lack of publicly available data for housing.  We were able to tie 10 years of Redfin data to few demographic
and economic indicators, but we had ideas for more features we would like to look into.  Specifically, being able to get housing data farther back than 10 years,
looking at historical prices for land, costs of construction, and being able to look into just how long it is taking to build housing are just a few missed opportunities
for our data to have been better filled out.  While researching articles for this project, we created a list of brainstormed data that we then attempted to find on the internet.


#### Project Design

##### 1. Research and Identification of Core Strategies
We commenced by conducting a comprehensive review of current strategies employed to address housing affordability. This
review focused on identifying the fundamental objectives these strategies aimed to achieve, such as increasing housing inventory,
stabilizing rental prices, and enhancing accessibility for low-income households.  The result of this review is a list of strategies
with their intended goal, seen in the dropdown below.  Using this strategy-goal list, we asked both Anthropic's Claude AI and OpenAI's
ChatGPT to analyze our dataset and to tag each strategy goal with both direct and indirect associations to the dataset features.  We then
curated the responses into a set of features to use to compare to the results of our analysis.

#### Feature Engineering
We were able to obtain a number of features related to affordability, including current rental prices, national monthly mortgage rates, median_sales_prices.  These allowed us to
create new variables specifically targeted to affordability.

###### **Reconciling Monthly and Yearly Data**
We noticed odd things when we plotted monthly vs yearly data in our scatter plot graphs.  Our data took on clumped column shapes.  And it did really seem representative of what happens in reality.
A county's median income does not suddently increase from one year to the next, for example.  Many of these variables will be different over smaller increments of time.
While consulting with our project statistician, Hank Ibser, he suggested that smoothing the transition of the yearly variables by taking the average change and cumulatively increasing
(or decreasing) the feature amount over the number of months of county data would be a better way to deal with the features than to leave large jumps from year to year.  This left the question
of what to do with the last year of data, since we do not have numbers beyond 2022.  We decided to average all of the previous deltas and apply that as our step up or down, then
proceeded to multiply that by the number of months of data we had and apply the incremental steps to the original rows.
We smoothed out the transitions in this way for the following variables: `median_income`, `population`, `num_housing_units`, `median_rent_2bdrm`, and `rental_vacancy`.

###### **Monthly Housing Payment**: `monthly_housing_payment`

We first created a variable to hold the median monthly mortgage payment, using the following formula:

<center>$$ M = .8P \frac{I(1 + I)^N }{(1 + I)^N − 1} $$ </center>

Where:<br>
<i>M</i> = `monthly_housing_payment`<br>
<i>P</i> = home sale price<br>
<i>I</i> = the interest rate<br>
<i>N</i> = the number of payments (360)<br>

We made this calculation based on a 20% down payment and a 30 year fixed term.  This is a big assumption, but gives us a baseline to look at affordability.

###### **Monthly Median Income**: `monthly_median_income`

<center>$$ mmi = \frac{mi}{12} $$ </center>

Where:<br>
<i>mmi</i> = `monthly_median_income`<br>
<i>mi</i> = `median_income`<br>


##### **Monthly Affordable Housing Payment**: `monthly_affordable_housing_payment`

This feature holds the maximum housing payment considered affordable, based on the HUD's affordability threshold of 30%.
<center>$$ mahp = .3 x mmi $$</center>

Where:<br>
<i>mahp</i> = `monthly_affordable_housing_payment`<br>
<i>mmi</i> = `median_income`<br>

#### Rental vs Home Ownership - A Project Decision Point
The aim of this project was to primarily look into unaffordable housing and housing consists, primarily, of 2 kinds
of housed individuals:  those who rent and those who own a home.  To decide if we should be focused on both rental unit prices and current home sales, we looked at the
current strategies and compared those strategies with our data to determine the most immediate need.

##### Evaluation of the current rental situation:
According to https://ipropertymanagement.com/research/homeownership-rate-by-state?u=%2Fresearch%2Fhomeownership-rate-by-state#oregon,
about 33% of Oregonians rent, based on the most up-to-date U.S. Census numbers.

##### 2. Data Exploration and Analysis
Utilizing publicly available datasets, we undertook the following statistical analysis:

### Fill this out with python used, specific tests run

* **Trend Analysis**: Examined temporal trends in affordability for both rental and housing prices to determine the feasibility and relevance of analyzing both sectors concurrently.
    + Mann-Kendal test for trend significance and direction
* **Correlation and Significance Testing**: Analyzed feature correlations and performed significance tests to identify key predictors of target variables (rent and median sale price).
* **Feature Importance Analysis**: Employed the `permutation_importance` function from the `sklearn` library to ascertain the importance of various features. A Random Forest Regressor model was constructed and evaluated to validate these findings.

##### 3. Identification of Significant Features
We identified the intersection of features with significant linear regression p-values and those deemed most important by the Random Forest model. This intersection provided robust evidence of features that were statistically correlated with housing prices. Subsequently, we compared these features with the strategies identified in the initial research phase to draw meaningful insights.

##### 4. Forecasting Housing Prices
Finally, leveraging the optimal Random Forest model, we developed a time series forecast to predict future housing prices. This predictive model aided in anticipating market trends and formulating effective strategies to enhance housing affordability.

## Stastical Analysis
Python 3.12.4 was used for data processing, statistical analysis, and plots for this study.  We performed descriptive analysis on the features in this dataset and we noted the lack of data
in some counties for earlier years.



Raw data

The first step was to research housing affordability trends in Oregon and determine what steps have been taken to keep housing affordable for Oregonians.
With this set of approaches, we wanted to identify the specific issues they are trying to solve - are they trying to help builders obtain land and build
faster?  Rent control?  Subsidies for builders to build more affordably?  We need to make a determination if the features they are trying to solve for
are represented in our data.  Maybe if they are trying to build up more inventory, num_housing_units or inventory is a good indicator.  Relaxing land use laws
or stretching the urban barrier seem to be an effort to increase inventory/num_housing_units.

Counties may represent features differently.  Aggregating by county, do scatter plots and linear regression to obtain p-values for each feature
measured against median_sale_price.  Look for features that are correlated and ensure there is no multicolinearity among them.

Now we have sets of features that represent 99% of the homes sold and are not multicolinear.  Are there common features among them?


--Aggregate to county level to get a more localized look at what is going on
The path to take here should probably be looking at several methods of feature importance and try to go with an intersecting set
of those features.  Build linear regression and a couple of ML models using those features.  If the models work out, we could say that these
features are significant and could be looked at as factors to take into account when looking into various types legislation.

1.  Looked at linear correlations with pearson correlation and linear regression measuring r^2 and p-value for significance.
1a. Mann-Kendall Trend - to look for significance of trends in housing and income over our timespan
2.  Created Linear Model to look at the affects of inventory and housing units on median sales prices.  Tested all
assumptions of linear regression to ensure the model was accurate.
3.  Created Random Forest, evaluated for error and accuracy.
4.  Created a timeseries forecast model using Random Forest.


Feature Engineering
1.  Engineered several features:
- median monthly payment consisting of average mortgage rate, number of payments (30 years), 80% of the median sale price
- unaffordability index - ratio of median sale price and median income (used in at least one article found - look up reference)


The methods used in this analysis consists of simple stastical analysis for correlations and time series trends, a random forest model, and a random forest model with time series data
