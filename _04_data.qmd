# Data

## Data Description and Variable Selection
After conducting thorough research to identify the key factors influencing housing prices, we collected data from various reputable sources. The dataset for this project comprises housing data from Redfin.com, demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau, median rental prices from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Developmentâ€™s Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R), and national mortgage rates from The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The specific features included in our dataset are detailed in the subsequent data section.



The data for this project were downloaded from various web sites as CSV files.  These files were processed both by hand
and using Python scripts to remove extraneous information such as data we were not interested in and states and counties
we were not interested in.  The CSV data were then transposed into a format for ingestion by an SQL script.

Data Dictionary
- A housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or if vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the building and which have direct access from the outside of the building or through a common hall.
