# Background

The right to housing is recognized worldwide in numerous human rights legal documents, including the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the US signed in 1948.  However, in recent years access
to affordable housing has become a major obstacle to home ownership and affordable rent across the
United States.  According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, “Research shows that
the shortage of affordable housing costs the American economy about $2 trillion a year in lower
wages and productivity.”  Due to a large number of interconnected factors over the last 20 years that include rapid population
growth, strict land use laws, land prices, neighborhood gentrification, interest rates, numerous unique
issues caused by the COVID pandemic, and increased construction costs and permit fees, many states have
seen housing affordability dwindle and homelessness grow.

Unaffordable housing has many impacts on the people it affects, which include:  1) having to commute to
work from an area they find more affordable, contributing to air pollution,  2) inability to save for
emergencies, creating a precarious situation in the event an expensive emergency does arise,  3) inability
to save for retirement or their children’s future,  4) physical and emotional stress over finances, and
5) greater likelihood of the homeless population growing due to lack of housing options.
