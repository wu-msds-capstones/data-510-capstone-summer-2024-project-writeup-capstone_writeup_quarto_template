# Background

Oregon is currently grappling with a significant housing crisis marked by a mismatch between the growing demand for housing and the availability of affordable housing options. This crisis has been exacerbated by a combination of rapid population growth, economic factors, and regulatory constraints. Understanding and addressing the barriers to affordable housing in Oregon is essential for developing effective strategies that can balance housing demand with affordability.

#### Population Growth and Housing Demand
Oregon's population has been growing steadily over the past decade. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the state experienced a population increase of approximately 10.6% from 2010 to 2020 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2021). This growth has been concentrated in urban areas such as Portland, Eugene, and Bend, leading to increased demand for housing in these regions. As more people move to these urban centers for job opportunities and quality of life, the pressure on the housing market intensifies, driving up home prices and rental rates.

#### Economic Factors
The economic landscape in Oregon has also contributed to the housing affordability crisis. Rising construction costs, driven by increasing prices for labor and materials, have made it more expensive to build new housing units (National Association of Home Builders, 2021). Additionally, land prices in desirable urban areas have surged, further compounding the cost of housing development (Glaeser & Gyourko, 2018). These economic factors create significant barriers for developers seeking to build affordable housing.

#### Regulatory and Policy Barriers
Regulatory constraints, such as zoning laws and land use regulations, play a critical role in shaping the housing market in Oregon. Urban growth boundaries, while designed to prevent urban sprawl and protect natural landscapes, have limited the availability of developable land, thereby increasing housing costs (Phillips & Goodstein, 2000). Furthermore, restrictive zoning laws often favor single-family homes over higher-density developments, reducing the potential supply of affordable housing options (Pendall, 2020).

#### Strategies to Address Housing Affordability
Various strategies have been proposed and implemented in Oregon to address the housing affordability crisis. Inclusionary zoning policies, for example, require or incentivize developers to include affordable units in new residential projects. The City of Portland has adopted such policies, aiming to increase the availability of affordable housing within new developments (City of Portland, 2017).

State-level legislation, such as Oregon's House Bill 2001, seeks to promote higher-density housing by allowing the construction of duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes in areas previously zoned for single-family homes (Oregon Legislature, 2019). This approach is intended to increase the housing supply and provide more affordable options.

Public-private partnerships are another critical strategy, leveraging public funds and private sector expertise to finance and build affordable housing projects. For instance, the Portland Housing Bond, a voter-approved initiative, aims to create 1,300 new affordable housing units in the city (City of Portland, 2021).

Innovative construction methods, including modular and prefabricated housing, offer potential solutions to reduce construction costs and increase the speed of housing production. These methods are being explored in Oregon as a way to address the housing shortage more effectively (Smith, 2021).

#### Research Objectives
This study aims to explore the barriers to affordable housing in Oregon by analyzing a comprehensive dataset that includes various economic 
and demographic factors and comparing those to key strategies that are used around the world to tackle housing affordability. By identifying
some key factors that influence affordability, the study seeks to provide some insight for policymakers, developers, and community stakeholders into what
strategies hold some promise at taming the affordability crisis.
