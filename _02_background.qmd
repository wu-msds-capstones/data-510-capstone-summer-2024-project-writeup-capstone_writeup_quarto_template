# Background

The right to housing is recognized worldwide in numerous human rights legal documents, including the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the US signed in 1948.  However, in recent years access
to affordable housing has become a major obstacle to home ownership and affordable rent across the
United States.  According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, “Research shows that
the shortage of affordable housing costs the American economy about $2 trillion a year in lower
wages and productivity.”  Due to a large number of interconnected factors over the last 20 years that include rapid population
growth, strict land use laws, land prices, neighborhood gentrification, interest rates, numerous unique
issues caused by the COVID pandemic, and increased construction costs and permit fees, many states have
seen housing affordability dwindle and homelessness grow.

Unaffordable housing has many impacts on the people it affects, which include:  1) having to commute to
work from an area they find more affordable, contributing to air pollution,  2) inability to save for
emergencies, creating a precarious situation in the event an expensive emergency does arise,  3) inability
to save for retirement or their children’s future,  4) physical and emotional stress over finances, and
5) greater likelihood of the homeless population growing due to lack of housing options.

##### Oregon, the Poster Child of Unaffordable Housing
The reasons for housing becoming less affordable over time are complex, but in Oregon, a number of papers tie the
passage to SB-100 in 1973 to an increasingly restrictive building environment.  Restrictive land use policies
slow development and increase land costs and create a crisis when demand rises in an area.

"It’s tempting to oversimplify how Oregon’s housing market failed to keep up with demand. Some people blame the state’s
stringent land-use laws for restricting the ability to expand where new construction could go. Others blame the
private sector’s control of real estate, or developers who only want to build large single-family homes, or
bureaucratic permitting processes."
"Lewis is among several researchers who have been digging into studies and data to help policymakers figure out how
Oregon reached a point of being 140,000 housing units short of what’s needed — and what it will take to dig the state
out of this hole." - https://www.opb.org/article/2023/07/26/oregon-cost-of-living-housing-construction-building-land-use-high-rent/
