    "text": "The right to housing is recognized worldwide in numerous human rights legal documents, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the US signed in 1948. However, in recent years access to affordable housing has become a major obstacle to home ownership and affordable rent across the United States. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, “Research shows that the shortage of affordable housing costs the American economy about $2 trillion a year in lower wages and productivity.” Due to a large number of interconnected factors over the last 20 years that include rapid population growth, strict land use laws, land prices, neighborhood gentrification, interest rates, numerous unique issues caused by the COVID pandemic, and increased construction costs and permit fees, many states have seen housing affordability dwindle and homelessness grow.\nOregon is experiencing a profound housing crisis characterized by an imbalance between the rapidly increasing demand for housing and the availability of affordable housing options. As the state’s population grows, particularly in urban centers such as Portland, Eugene, and Bend, the pressure on the housing market has intensified, leading to soaring home prices and rental rates. This trend has created significant challenges for low- and middle-income families, who are increasingly unable to find affordable housing. The severity of this issue calls for a comprehensive analysis of the barriers to affordable housing and the development of effective strategies to address them."

    "text": "Stastical Analysis\nPython 3.12.4 was used for data processing, statistical analysis, and plots for this study. We performed descriptive analysis on the features in this dataset and we noted the lack of data in some counties for earlier years.\nRaw data\nThe first step was to research housing affordability trends in Oregon and determine what steps have been taken to keep housing affordable for Oregonians. With this set of approaches, we wanted to identify the specific issues they are trying to solve - are they trying to help builders obtain land and build faster? Rent control? Subsidies for builders to build more affordably? We need to make a determination if the features they are trying to solve for are represented in our data. Maybe if they are trying to build up more inventory, num_housing_units or inventory is a good indicator. Relaxing land use laws or stretching the urban barrier seem to be an effort to increase inventory/num_housing_units.\nCounties may represent features differently. Aggregating by county, do scatter plots and linear regression to obtain p-values for each feature measured against median_sale_price. Look for features that are correlated and ensure there is no multicolinearity among them.\nNow we have sets of features that represent 99% of the homes sold and are not multicolinear. Are there common features among them?\n–Aggregate to county level to get a more localized look at what is going on The path to take here should probably be looking at several methods of feature importance and try to go with an intersecting set of those features. Build linear regression and a couple of ML models using those features. If the models work out, we could say that these features are significant and could be looked at as factors to take into account when looking into various types legislation.\n\nLooked at linear correlations with pearson correlation and linear regression measuring r^2 and p-value for significance. 1a. Mann-Kendall Trend - to look for significance of trends in housing and income over our timespan\nCreated Linear Model to look at the affects of inventory and housing units on median sales prices. Tested all assumptions of linear regression to ensure the model was accurate.\nCreated Random Forest, evaluated for error and accuracy.\nCreated a timeseries forecast model using Random Forest.\n\nFeature Engineering 1. Engineered several features: - median monthly payment consisting of average mortgage rate, number of payments (30 years), 80% of the median sale price - unaffordability index - ratio of median sale price and median income (used in at least one article found - look up reference)\nThe methods used in this analysis consists of simple stastical analysis for correlations and time series trends, a random forest model, and a random forest model with time series data"

    "text": "Data Description and Variable Selection\nAfter conducting thorough research to identify the key factors influencing housing prices, we collected data from various reputable sources. The dataset for this project comprises housing data from Redfin.com, demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau, median rental prices from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R), and national mortgage rates from The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The specific features included in our dataset are detailed in the subsequent data section.\nThe data for this project were downloaded from various web sites as CSV files. These files were processed both by hand and using Python scripts to remove extraneous information such as data we were not interested in and states and counties we were not interested in. The CSV data were then transposed into a format for ingestion by an SQL script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Data ERD\n\n\n\nSee Figure 1 for an illustration.\nData Dictionary - A housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or if vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the building and which have direct access from the outside of the building or through a common hall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Dictionary - Features Aggregated Monthly By County - Click to Expand\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Dictionary - Redfin Data, Monthly By County\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nDescription\nSource\n\n\n\n\ncounty\nOregon county\n\n\n\ndate\nDate sampled or calculated in yyyy/mm/dd format\nRedfin Data\n\n\ninventory\nTotal number of active listings on the market on the last day of the time period.\nRedfin Data\n\n\nmedian_sale_price\nThe median final sale price of homes that sold during a given time period\nRedfin Data\n\n\nhomes_sold\nCount of closed home sales during a given time period\nRedfin Data\n\n\nnew_listings\nTotal number of homes listed for sale during a given time period\nRedfin Data\n\n\ndays_on_market\nThe median number of days homes that went under contract during a given time period spent on the market before going under contract\nRedfin Data\n\n\naverage_sale_to_list\nA measurement of how close the typical home’s final price was to its original list price.
