##### Research and Identification of Core Strategies


Using the analysis of the strategy-tagged features above, we moved forward with the following set of indicators to analyze:

independent variables = `new_listings`, `inventory`, `num_housing_units`,
`median_income`, `population`, `property_tax`, `homes_sold`, `days_on_market`

dependent variable = `median_sale_price`

**Scatter Plot Samples**

What we found early on in the analysis was that there is a big difference in how features respond to `median_sale_prices`
depending on the county density.  For example, the following scatter plot clusters are from Washington and Wheeler Counties.
This is a trend that will show up all through the analysis.

**Trend Plots and MK numbers**

Trend analysis for time series is interesting to plot.  We found out a lot about this data by plotting this data over time.  You can see in the 
trends below that the densely populated counties (top 2 graphs) are trend in a similar manner, but differ from the sparsely populated counties
(bottom 2 graphs).

**Homes Sold Feature Significance**
After the home sold feature significance study, we narrowed the features to:

inventory 99.91256033101263
num_housing_units 99.984587972013
median_income 99.984587972013

property_tax 99.984587972013
days_on_market 99.81316847705574

Findings:

1.  Regression fits well to densely populated counties with a median_sale_price target.
2.  Sparsely populated counties are best modeled by their median rental prices.



This is what I want to focus on:

Plain Linear Regression:

['num_housing_units', 'days_on_market', 'inventory']
R^2: 0.9550268107703429, MAE: 18.991051374287636, RMSE: 24.584835761694823
Using the Anderson-Darling test for normal distribution
p-value from the test - below 0.05 generally means non-normal: 0.060124359532653535
Residuals are normally distributed
[[86.72340057 -7.53914015  0.23939715]]

This value 86.72 is a strong indicator that if you increase housing units, median house prices will rise.
This is surprising given that a lot of the focus is on building more housing at a faster pace.
What's up with this?  Does it hold true for other counties?
