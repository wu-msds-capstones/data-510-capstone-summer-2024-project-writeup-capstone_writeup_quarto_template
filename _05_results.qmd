### Feature Set For Analysis

Using the analysis of the strategy-tagged features above, we moved forward with the following set of indicators to analyze:

`new_listings`, `inventory`, `median_sale_price`, `num_housing_units`,
`median_income`, `population`, `property_tax`, `homes_sold`, `days_on_market`


After the home sold feature significance study, we narrowed the features to:

inventory 99.91256033101263
num_housing_units 99.984587972013
median_income 99.984587972013
population 99.1469914305979
property_tax 99.984587972013
days_on_market 99.81316847705574

Add a list of values that came out of the strategy goal data search.

Add scatter plots and correlation tables




Findings:

1.  Regression fits well to densely populated counties with a median_sale_price target.
2.  Sparsely populated counties are best modeled by their median rental prices.
